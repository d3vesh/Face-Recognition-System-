# Face-Recognition-System
Basic Face detection Algorithm,a first step to Computer Vision using Python,OpenCV and Haar Feature-based cascade Classifier. <br>
## Face detection Algorithm <br>
Locating/detecting faces (human/animals) from an image. <br>
Drawing Rectangle surrounding face. <br>
Count of number of faces in the image. <br>
## Face Recognition (Webcam) <br>
