# Face-Recognition-System
Basic Face detection Algorithm,a 
first step to Computer Vision 
using Python,OpenCV and Haar 
Feature-based cascade Classifier.
Its my attempt to learn the basics
of OpenCV and Computer Vision <br>

## Face detection Algorithm <br>

Locating/detecting faces (human/animals) from an image. <br>
Drawing Rectangle surrounding face. <br>
Count of number of faces in the image. <br>

## Face Recognition (Webcam) <br>
Detecting Face on webcam in real time by setting normal image recognition system on infinite loop untill interrupted.
